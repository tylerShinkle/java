compilingPackages

Best is to compile and run the classes from outside the packages :

First you compile with javac :

$javac MyPack/AccountBalance.java
this will create a new file in the MyPack folder called AccountBalance.class

then you can run it :

$java MyPack.AccountBalance
By the way: it is discouraged to have package names start with a capital.
